## Tools/dependencies we will be using

-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/6.26.3/) to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in old browsers or environments.
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) It removes all original styling\* and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
-   [Jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/) this will help in Documentation.
-   Also install the Prettier extension on you IDE.

## Commands

-   `npm start` compile the code, start server and show result in browser.
-   `npm build` compile the code and save it to "dist" folder.
